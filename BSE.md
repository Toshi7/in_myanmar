# About BSE

## What is BSE ?

A Bridge System Engineer (Bridge Software Engineer) is a liason between offshore and onshore development teams. Their primary function is to make sure that the offshore team understands the requirements, that questions from the offshore team get answers (and often translations of those answers), etc.

In a lot of ways it's being a project or development manager, but focused on the offshore/onshore interface.
